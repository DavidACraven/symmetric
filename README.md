This contains Magma intrinsics for computing in symmetric groups. Please see symmetric.pdf for a full description of the new functionality this produces.

The matrix needed to compute restrictions of characters from Sym(128) to a Sylow 2-subgroup is too big to be added to GitHub. Please see the author's webpage
or the auxiliary materials for the arXiv article "On the irreducible character degrees of symmetric groups and their multiplicities" for the full package,
complete with this (large) matrix.
